# GettingAndCleaningData-Project
Project to fetch and clean up the data


### Dataset 

Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of daily living while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors - sourced from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Goal

Ultimate goal is to fetch the data and tidy it up so that it can be used for analysis further

### Requirement

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
